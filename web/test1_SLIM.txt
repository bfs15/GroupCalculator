///////
This is the SLIM version of the logs

RECOMMENDED for first viewing as they are more clear, but they also ommit some details that are present in the FULL version.
* The sending/receiving of heartbeats are mostly cut from the slim (this) version of logs for the sake of readability, they appear a bit when the servers are restarting on the second part of this test where they become more relevant  *
* opening and closing of sockets are also ommited in the client and server response *

* This message [Remote 3] Heartbeat, delta = 5783ms; dev = 445 *
* means this server received a heartbeat from Server 3, 5783ms since last heartbeat (or server startup if this is the first one), with deviation of 445ms *
* The sending/receiving of heartbeats are cut from the slim (this) version of logs for the sake of readability, but here in this part of the test they are very important *
